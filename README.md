# JsonPowerDB_CRUD
This project focuses on the basic Create, Read, Update & Delete (CRUD Functionalities) of JsonPowerDB.
# About JsonPowerDB
JSON is a lightweight text-based open standard data-interchange format. It is human readable. JSON is derived from a subset of JavaScript programming language (Standard ECMA-262 3rd Editionâ€”December 1999). It is entirely language independent and can be used with most of the modern programming languages.

JSON is often used to serialize and transfer data over a network connection, for example between the web server and a web application. In computer science, serialization is a process to transforming data structures and objects in a format suitable to be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted over a network connection. Later on, this data can be retrieved. Because of the very nature of the JSON, it is useful for storing or representing semi structured data.
